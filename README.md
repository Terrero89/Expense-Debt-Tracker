4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Getting Started
This skeleton contains two different applications -- a front end, or "client," created with "Create React App," and a back end, or "API," created with Express.

In order to make both of them work together, you'll need to run both, As we work on this project, you'll first focus on the side assigned to be worked while both are running. 


## Client

Latest checked | @Tue May 5th, 2024 12:00pm GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)

In order to run the client, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend/
sudo npm i                  # 15 vulnerabilities (7 moderate, 6 high, 2 critical)
sudo npm audit fix          # 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high)
npm install braces@2.3.1    # missing module install
npm start
```

## BACKEND/API

Latest checked | @Tue Jan 30 2024 19:10:36 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)

In order to run the server, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd backend/
sudo npm i                  # 8 vulnerabilities (1 low, 4 high, 3 critical)
sudo npm audit fix          # 8 vulnerabilities (1 low, 4 high, 3 critical)
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:9000` in your browser and see the server running.

## MONGODB

In order to configure the mongodb native drivers for node.js 5.5 or later, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
sudo npm install mongodb
```

## EXPRESS

```bash
sudo npm install express
```
