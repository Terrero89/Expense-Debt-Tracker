## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Navigate to the frontend or backend directory.
4. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend.

## Getting Started
this boilerplate contains two different applications -- a frontend, or "frontend," created with "Create React App," and a back end, or "Backend," created with Express.

To make both of them work together, you'll need to run both, As we work on this project, you'll first focus on the side assigned to be worked while both are running. 


## Client

In order to run the client, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend/
sudo npm i                  # 15 vulnerabilities (7 moderate, 6 high, 2 critical)
sudo npm audit fix          # 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high)
npm install braces@2.3.1    # missing module install
npm start
```

## BACKEND/API

In order to run the server, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd backend/
sudo npm i                  # 8 vulnerabilities (1 low, 4 high, 3 critical)
sudo npm audit fix          # 8 vulnerabilities (1 low, 4 high, 3 critical)
npm run serve
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:8080` in your browser and see the server running.
